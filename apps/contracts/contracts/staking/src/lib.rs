#![no_std]
//! Staking — token staking and rewards contract for AfriDollar.
//!
//! Stakers lock a supported `asset` for at least `min_stake_duration` and
//! accrue rewards in a (possibly different) `reward_asset`, at a rate fixed
//! per second per staked token. Rewards are paid out on demand via
//! `claim_rewards`; principal is only returned via `unstake`, and only once
//! the lock has expired.
//!
//! ## Design notes: two fields beyond the original spec
//!
//! [`StakingPosition`] carries two fields beyond what was originally
//! sketched for this contract (`reward_rate`, `pending_rewards`). Both exist
//! to satisfy the acceptance criterion "reward rate changes apply to new
//! stakes only" *correctly*:
//!
//! * `reward_rate` — a snapshot of [`RewardConfig::reward_rate`] taken the
//!   moment a position is *first opened* by `stake`. If rewards were
//!   instead computed from the *live* `RewardConfig` at claim time, an
//!   admin's `set_reward_rate` call would silently change the accrual rate
//!   for every already-open position — exactly what the acceptance
//!   criterion says must not happen. A top-up on an existing position does
//!   **not** re-snapshot this rate either (see `stake`'s doc comment) —
//!   only a brand-new position picks up the current config rate.
//! * `pending_rewards` — rewards accrued but not yet paid out. Whenever a
//!   position's `amount` is about to change (a top-up stake, or a partial
//!   `unstake`), the reward owed for the *elapsed time under the old
//!   amount/rate* is settled into this bucket first (see
//!   [`settle_accrual`]), so past accrual is never lost, recomputed at a
//!   new rate, or double-counted.
//!
//! `RewardConfig::reward_asset` is immutable once set for a given `asset`
//! (see `set_reward_config`) — this guarantees `claim_rewards` always pays
//! out in the same token stakers expected when they opened their position.
//!
//! Every other field matches the original `StakingPosition`/`RewardConfig`
//! shape. All contract entrypoints return `Result<_, Error>` rather than
//! bare values, matching this repo's established convention (see the
//! `counter` reference contract) rather than the bare-return signatures
//! originally sketched for this issue.
